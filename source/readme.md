## benefits: 
* write complicated automations that are intuitive.  
* avoid delaying for unnecessary amounts of time.  
* make development fun for developers.  


## todo: 

* native.test.ts
  * waitFor should check to see if the element is already there.  Then wait for structural changes to see if the element shows up.  
  * Fix the issue with addStructureChanged event handler.  The ThreadSafeFunction is not getting released.
